# About me

Hello,

I’m currently doing a 12 month internship as a Software Engineer at Wish.

I’m also currently a fourth year student at the University Of Toronto, and aim to finish a Computer Science Specialist degree with a minor in Mathematical Sciences. My favourite languages are Python and Typescript for web development. 

In my free time I love doing calisthenics, playing and watching soccer, and anything related to video games. I also run a youtube channel with my brother, where we upload videos about data visualizations related to sports, that has gained over 3000 subscribers and millions of views. 

If you’d like to contact me, you can reach me through my email: stalha.ali@mail.utoronto.ca or stalhaali1234@gmail.com
